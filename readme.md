This is a dummy project for HW1A for ACS567 SPM.

This project runs with PostgresSQL and NodeJs.

Individual readmes for backend and frontend can be found inside the respective folders.

Else you can run the backend with > Python3.9. To install the requirements use pip install -r requirements.txt. You need to install postgres natively in your system, refer to Postgres original documentation. Once you are done use the SQL provided to create the database and run app.py.

Frontend is created with react, so native react commands should work as is.
